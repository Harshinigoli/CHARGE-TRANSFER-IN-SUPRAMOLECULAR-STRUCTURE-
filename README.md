# CHARGE-TRANSFER-IN-SUPRAMOLECULAR-STRUCTURE-
Self assembly of wide range of molecules has been reported with a diverse mechanistic statistics involved. The complex architectures formed by self assembly are considered to carry pristine data with nano technological applications. Inter and intra-molecular interaction involved in the process of self assembly have resulted in enormous range of nano materialistic structures which when put forth in biological innovations has thrown an extraordinary output. Most thin film technology based devices, including thin film transistors, data storage memory, solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, thermoelectric devices, smart materials, sensors, and actuators are charge transfer mechanism dependent. Charge transfer can act as a driving force for self assembly when there is a possibility for non-covalent interactions to occur between the molecules involved in it. 
The combination of an electron deficient and an electron rich moiety with adequate synergy can lead to a supra molecular aggregation. The pyrene moiety which is an electron rich species donates electron to an electron deficient molecule which results in an intercalating structure and leads to self assembly. The structural compatibility between the acceptor and the donor is also very crucial for self assembly. One of the main reasons why pyrene is used so frequently in such diverse scientific fields is the facile control over the structural and electronic properties of pyrene by chemical manipulations. Introducing fluorine atoms can enhance the charge-carrier mobility due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Partial fluorination leads to significantly improved material stability and has been argued to be a subtle route toward promoting self assembly without disrupting the crucial, albeit weak, π−π stacking interactions that allow for efficient transport in organic semiconductors.
 Hence here in our study we choose FKP (Fmoc-L-Lysine Pyrene) which is an electron rich species and TNF (2, 4, 7-trinitro-9-ﬂuorenone) which is an electron deficient moiety. Though DPP was an electron deficient moiety, it was not able to intercalate between the pyrene rings of FKP due to structural incompatibility and lack of chemical complementarities. TNF which has been observed to exhibit compatibility with FKP and has aligned itself with the TNF, showed self assembly when mixed in equi molar ratio. The self assembly of FKP with TNF has already been reported in ambidextrous gel state. We now, reported the supra-molecular self assembly of the same in film coated form which has the further applications in the above mentioned fields. Organic electronic materials offer a promising route toward low-cost, large-area devices and are now commonly used in the form of organic light-emitting diode displays.

DISCUSSION
The brown color in KFP+TNF was observed because of the charge transfer. When compared to only FKP the fluorescence in FKP+TNF was very much reduced because of the interference of TNF in between the layers of FKP, leading to inhibition of piling up of pyrene rings and thus interrupting the fluorescence emission of FKP. Where as in FKP+DPP the change in color was visually not observed. This primary observation indicates the possibility of the absence of charge transfer. The compound microscopic and SEM images evidently show the physical association between the FKP and TNF molecules. Whereas the interaction of FKP and DPP was not observed as we were able to distinguish the FKP and DPP molecules.
